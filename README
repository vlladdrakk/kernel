This is the current state of my kernel. I had memory management working and
began to work on process management, but hit a snag with paging. There seems to
be a bug in the code I am using for cloning page directories and tables. When
I try to load a page directory that was cloned the virtual machine gets into
a boot looping state. I'm still working out how to fix it.

I created a file called user_main.c which is where you can add your code. It is
called from initialize_tasking() in task.c, but at the moment it creates a page
fault.

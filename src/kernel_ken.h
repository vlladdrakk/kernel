// OUTPUT FUNCTIONS

// To better assist with consistency between students kernels, the following
//   functions have been added. You can simply have your implementation of
//   the functions wrapper the sys_call_monitor* functions that are provided
//   as part of the initital kernel code.

// Output a null-terminated ASCII string to the monitor
void print(const char *c);

// Print an unsigned integer to the monitor in base 16
void print_hex(unsigned int n);

// Print an unsigned integer to the monitor in base 10
void print_dec(unsigned int n);

// MEMORY MANAGEMENT

// Allocates a contiguous region of memory 'size' in the user heap. If
//   page_align==1, it creates that block starting on a page boundary.
void *alloc(unsigned int size, unsigned char page_align);

// Releases a block from the user heap allocated with 'alloc'.
//   p is a reference to the memory to be deallocated. 
void free(void *p);

// PROCESS MANAGEMENT
//
// Processes will be scheduled according to priority. Priorities range from 1 to
// 10. 1 is the highest. To prevent against high priority processes starving low
// priority processes, you are to implement dynamic priorities. At the expiration
// of each quantum, the scheduler can decrease the priority of the current 
// running process (thereby penalizing it for taking that much CPU time). 
// Eventually its priority will fall below that of the next highest process and
// that process will be allowed to run.
//
// Another approach is to have the scheduler keep track of low priority
// processes that do not get a chance to run and increase their priority so that
// eventually the priority will be high enough so that the processes will get
// scheduled to run. Once it runs for its quantum, the priority can be brought
// back to the previous low level.
//
// This periodic boosting of a process’ priority to ensure it gets a chance to
// run is called process aging. A simple way to implement aging is to simply
// increase every process’ priority and then have them get readjusted as they
// execute.

// Initialises the tasking system. Any data structures or initialization of
//   the system that is necessary before your first call to fork() must be
//   done in this function. For example, establishing your ready queue.
void initialise_tasking();

// Forks the current process, spawning a new one with a different
//   memory space. For the parent, the return value is the pid of
//   the new process. For the child, the return value is 0.
int fork();

// Terminates the current process, cleaning up the resources allocated
//   to the process.
void exit();

// Causes the process to surrender the CPU. The result is that the process
//   with the highest priority is assigned the CPU. Note: This may be the
//   current process *if* it is the highest priority.
void yield();

// Causes the process to surrender the CPU and go to sleep for n seconds.
//   The function returns 0 if the requested time has elapsed, or the 
//   number of seconds left to sleep, if the call was interrupted by a
//          signal handler.
int sleep(unsigned int secs);

// Returns the pid of the current process.
int getpid();

// Set the priority of the process. pid is the process id returned by
//   getpid(). newpriority is the new priority value between 1 and 10,
//   where 1 is highest priority. The return value is the resulting
//   priority of the pid. If the pid is invalid then the return value is 0.
int setpriority(int pid, int new_priority);

// PROCESS SYNCHRONIZATION

//   A semaphore must be initialized by open_sem() before it can be used.
//   Processes waiting on a semaphore are resumed on a first-come first-served
//   basis.

//  n is the number of processes that can be granted access to the critical
//  region for this semaphore simultaneously. The return value is a semaphore
//  identifier to be used by signal and wait. 0 indicates open_sem failed.
int open_sem(int n);

// The invoking process is requesting to acquire the semaphore, s. If the
//   internal counter allows, the process will continue executing after acquiring
//   the semaphore. If not, the calling process will block and release the
//   processor to the scheduler. Returns semaphore id on success of acquiring
//   the semaphore, 0 on failure.
int wait(int s);

// The invoking process will release the semaphore, if and only if the process
//   is currently holding the semaphore. If a process is waiting on
//   the semaphore, the process will be granted the semaphore and if appropriate
//   the process will be given control of the processor, i.e. the waking process
//   has a higher scheduling precedence than the current process. The return value
//   is the seamphore id on success, 0 on failure.
int signal(int s);

// Close the semaphore s and release any associated resources. If s is invalid then
//   return 0, otherwise the semaphore id.
int close_sem(int s);

// INTERPROCESS COMMUNICATION:
// 
// pipes are first-in-first-out bounded buffers. Elements are read in the same
//   order as they were written. When writes overtake reads, the first unread
//   element will be dropped. Thus, ordering is always preserved.
//  "read" and "write" on pipes are atomic, i.e., they are indivisible, and
//   they are non-blocking. All pipes are of the same size.

#define INVALID_PIPE -1

// Initialize a new pipe and returns a descriptor. It returns INVALID_PIPE
//   when none is available.
int open_pipe();

// Write the first nbyte of bytes from buf into the pipe fildes. The return value is the
//   number of bytes written to the pipe. If the pipe is full, no bytes are written.
//   Only write to the pipe if all nbytes can be written.
unsigned int write(int fildes, const void *buf, unsigned int nbyte);

// Read the first nbyte of bytes from the pipe fildes and store them in buf. The
//   return value is the number of bytes successfully read. If the pipe is 
//   invalid, it returns -1.
unsigned int read(int fildes, void *buf, unsigned int nbyte);

// Close the pipe specified by fildes. It returns INVALID_PIPE if the fildes
//   is not valid.
int close_pipe(int fildes);
